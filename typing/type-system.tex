\subsection{The $\λ\&-calculus$}

\subsubsection{Patterns}

In order to type patterns, we need to introduce a new form of typing judgement.
The judgement $\Γ \dashv p:\τ$ means that when applied against a type $\τ$, the
pattern $p$ will enrich the environment with the constraints $\Γ$.

For example, we got $x:\Int \dashv x:\Int$, which reads ``If we apply a term
of type $\Int$ to the pattern $x$, then the environment on the
right of the pattern will be enriched with the constraint $x:\Int$''

Likewise, the following statement holds.
\[x:\Int; y: \Bool \dashv \left\{ x; y ? \text{true}; \right\} : \{ x = \Int; y =? \Bool \}\]
This means that when if we match a term of type $\left\{ x =\Int; y =? \Bool
\right\}$ against the pattern $\left\{ x; y ? \text{true}; \right\}$, then the
environment on the right side of the pattern will be enriched with the
constraints $x : \Int$ and $y : \Bool$.

As the symbol ``$\dashv$'' suggests, this typing judgement is the converse of
the classical typing judgement $\Γ \vdash e : \τ$ for expressions: instead of
stating that under the hypothesis $\Γ$, the expression $e$ has type $\τ$, we
state that if the pattern $p$ has type $\τ$, then in produces the environment
$\Γ$.

The typing rules for this statement are given by the
figure~\pref{typing::patterns::typing-rules}.

Maybe~\todo{Find out wether this is true} this enjoys principal typing.

\subsubsection{Typecase}

The typecase $(x := e \in t) ? e_1 : e_2$ can be typed in a simple way, by
saying that if $e$ has a type $τ$, $e_1$ has type $\τ_1$ and $e_2$ has type
$\τ_2$ (under the current typing environment $\Γ$), then $(x := e \in t) ? e_1
: e_2$ has type $\τ_1 \vee \τ_2$.
However, doing so means that we do not use the extra type information given by
``$e \in t$'', which loosens a lot the interest of this construct. For example,
an expression such as $(x := e \in \bm{{Int}}) ? x + 1 : x$, with $\vdash e :
\any$ wouldn't typecheck, as $x+1$ isn't well typed without any further
constraint on the type of $x$.

A more interesting typing rule would state that if $\Γ; x:\τ \wedge t \vdash
e_1: \τ_1$ and $\Γ; x:\τ \wedge \lnot t \vdash e_2: \τ_2$ (where $\τ$ is a type
of $e$ under the hypothesis $\Γ$), then the whole expression has type $\τ_1
\vee \τ_2$.
With this rule, the expression $(x := e \in \bm{{Int}}) ? x + 1 : x$ is
well-typed (provided that $e$ is).

The typing rules are given by the
figures~\pref{typing::lambda-calculus},~\pref{typing::records}
and~\pref{typing::operators}.

\subsection{Bidirectional typing}

The rules defined above are already quite expressive. However, they aren't
enough to type the following function, no matter how the type annotations are
written:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=NLight]
  (lambda cond. lambda x.  (y = cond in true) ? x+1 : not x
  : (true -> Int -> Int & false -> Bool -> Bool))
\end{lstlisting}

Indeed, do to this we would need to annotate $x$ as \ty{Int} or \ty{Bool}
depending on wether \texttt{cond} was \ty{true} or \ty{false}, which isn't
possible.

To remedy this problem, we split our type system in two parts: an inference
part and a checking part.  The inference part − denoted with typing judgements
of the form $\Γ \tinfer e : \τ$ − corresponds to classical bottom-up
type-inference, while the checking part − denoted with typing judgements of the
form $\Γ \tcheck e : \τ$ corresponds to a top-down type inference, where the
type of the expression is already known and we use it to infer the type of the
sub-expressions − in other words, we propagate the type annotations to the
bottom while type-checking. In particular, this ``checking'' type-system allows
us a more precise typing of lambdas.

Explicitly annotated let-bindings are thus typed using the checking type-system
and we can rewrite the previous expression as
\begin{lstlisting}[language=NLight]
let f : (true -> Int -> Int & false -> Bool -> Bool) =
 lambda cond. lambda x.  (y = cond tin true) ? x+1 : not x
in f
\end{lstlisting}

In this case, we just have to \emph{check} that
\begin{lstlisting}[language=NLight]
lambda x. (y = cond tin true) ? x+1 : not x
\end{lstlisting}
has type $\ty{Int} \rightarrow \ty{Int}$ under the hypothesis $\texttt{cond} :
\ty{true}$ and $\ty{Bool} \rightarrow \ty{Bool}$ under the hypothesis
$\texttt{cond} : \ty{false}$. This means checking that
\begin{lstlisting}[language=NLight]
(y = cond tin true) ? x+1 : not x
\end{lstlisting}
has type $\ty{Int}$ under the hypothesis $\texttt{cond} : \ty{true}; \texttt{x}
: \ty{Int}$ and $\ty{Bool}$ under the hypothesis $\texttt{cond} : \ty{false};
\texttt{x} : Bool$. This is true, thanks to the rules TcaseL and TcaseR of the
type system (figure~\pref{typing::lambda-calculus}).
