The grammar of nix-light is based of the grammar of nix and brings several
modifications:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A first huge change is the removal of the \emph{if} construct which is
    replaced by a more general \emph{typecase} which is easier to reason on.

  \item Another notable change is that the opaque list construct of nix is
    replaced by the classical \texttt{nil} and \texttt{cons}.
    This avoids having over-complicated typing and evaluation rules for lists.

    For consistency, a pattern for lists has also been added.
\end{itemize}

The grammar of nix-light is given in the
figures~\pref{grammar::expressions},~\pref{grammar::values}
and~\pref{grammar::types} (the types are the same as nix types).
