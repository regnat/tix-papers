Both languages are rather similar, so the compilation is mostly
straightforward: nix lambdas are compiled to nix-light lambdas; nix constants
to nix-light constants, and so on\ldots. The intersesting parts are:

\begin{description}
  \item[If-then-else's] Those are compiled, to typecases, as said
    in~\autoref{sec:nix-light-grammar}. However, there are several
    possibilities for this.

    The obvious one is to translate \lstinline{if $e$ then $e_1$ else $e_2$} into
    \lstinline{($x$ := ($e$ : Bool) tin true) ? $e_1$ : $e_2$} (where $x$ do not appear
    free in $e_1$ or $e_2$).
    However, the interest of the typecase is that it gives us some information
    on the type of $x$, that we can't use at all here. So this translation
    isn't very interesting.
    When possible, we will  to define smarter compilations for some forms of
    if-then-else.

    The most notable pattern that we want to recognize is
    \lstinline{if $f$ $x$ then $e_1$ else $e_2$} where $f \in
    \mathbb{D}$\footnote{Defined in~\autoref{sec:nix-typing}}.
    Such an expression will be compiled to a typecase of the form
    \lstinline{($x$ := $x$ tin $\mathcal{T}(f)$) ? $e_1$ : $e_2$}, which will
    later allow us to take advantage of the knowledge of the type of $x$.

  \item[Lists] Nix opaque lists are replaced in nix-light by the more
    conventional algebraic datatype built using the \lstinline{Cons} and
    \lstinline{Nil} constructors.
    This translation is rather easy: the compilation simply considers that
    \lstinline{[ $e_1$ $\cdots$ $e_n$ ]} is syntactic sugar for
    \lstinline{Cons($e_1$, Cons($\cdots$, Cons($e_n$, Nil)))} %chktex 36

The exact semantics of nix in term of nix-light are given by the
Figure~\pref{compilation}.
