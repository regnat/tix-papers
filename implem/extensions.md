The language we until here referred to as Nix was only a subset of the actual
Nix language.

We here present some parts of the language that have been omitted until now and
an informal typing for them.

### The import function

The import statement^[Which is just a function in Nix, but with a very special
semantic] allows importing other files. Its syntax is `import e` where `e`
should evaluate to a string representing an absolute path.
The semantic of this is that if the body of the file `s` reduces to a value
`v`, then `import s` reduces to `v` (so this isn't a textual inclusion: the
current scope isn't available in the imported file).

We here restrict ourselves to the cases where the argument of import is a
literal string (which means that the included file is statically known).

The syntax of Nix-light operators is extended as follows:

```
<operators> :: = ... | import (<expr>)
```

Where the expression in argument is the content of the imported file.
This means that we also add a compilation rule of the form:

\begin{displaymath}
  °(|import s|)° = °import(e)° \text{ where } °e° = \operatorname{PARSE}(°s°)
\end{displaymath}

Where "PARSE" is a (meta-)function which parses the file at the given location.

We also add a reduction rule

\begin{displaymath}
  °import(e)° \rightsquigarrow °e°
\end{displaymath}

and the convention that variable substitutions don't propagate under the
`import` operator.

The typing rule for this operator is rather simple:

\begin{displaymath}
\inferrule{\tIC e : \τ}{\Gamma \tIC \operatorname{import}(e): \τ}
\end{displaymath}

### The with construct

Nix accepts expressions of the form `with <expr>; <expr>`.
The meaning of this is that, provided that the first expression evaluates to a
record `{ x1 = e1; $\cdots$; xn = en }`, then the second one is evaluated with
the content of the record in scope, i.e. with the new variables `x1`, \ldots,
`xn` available with value respectivly `e1`, \ldots, `en`.
Moreover, if a variable is already in the scope, then it can't be shadowed by a
`with` construct.

Given its weird semantic and the difficulty to type it (greatly improved by the
high versatility of the records in Nix), this construct isn't presented at all
here.
It should be possible however to type it in some simple enough contexts.

### Throw/assert and tryEval

Nix has a notion of exceptions (although their exact nature isn't documented at
all).
In particular, ther exists a `throw` function (which raises an exception with a
given message) and an `assert` construct (of the form `assert <expr>; <expr>`)
which exists with an error if the first expression doesn't evaluates to `true`
and evaluates the second one otherwise.
The `throw` function can be directly compiled to a function of type
`String -> Any` and `assert e1; e2`; can be compiled to
`if e1 then e2 else throw "assertion failed`.

The `tryEval` function implements a form of exception catching: if its argument
raises an exception, it evaluates to `{ success = false; value = false; }`.
Otherwise, if its arguments evaluates to a value `v`, it evaluates to
`{ success = true; value = v; }`.
As long as we don't try to track exceptions, a reasonable rule for this is:

\begin{displaymath}
  \inferrule{\Gamma \vdash e : \τ}{%
    \Gamma \vdash \operatorname{tryEval}(e) : \{ success = \text{Bool}; value = \text{Bool} \vee \τ \}}
\end{displaymath}

(note that in presence of polymorphism, it would have been enough to type
`tryEval` as a function of type
`$\forall \alpha$. $\alpha$ -> { success = Bool; value = $\alpha$ | Bool}`).
