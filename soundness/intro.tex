The \emph{subject reduction} property does not hold for our type system.
Indeed, the checking part makes uses of annotations which are lost during
reduction, and designing a reduction system which keeps those annotations would
be non-trivial at all and would require the reduction system to be deeply
dependant on the structure of the types, which we want to avoid.
But we can imagine an extension of our type-system that would be able to guess
the type of any expression, and would just have to check it (some kind of
``oracle'' type-system).

In this section, we present such a type-system, and proove that subject
reduction and progress both hold for it.
As both the ``infer'' and ``check'' type-systems are restrictions of the oracle
type-system (\emph{i.e.} every term well-typed in one of those is well-typed in
the oracle), we get as corollary the soundness of those.
